Notice the way the air fills your lungs and then leaves your body.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nNow, turn your attention inward. Begin to feel the sensations in your body starting from the top of your head. Gradually scan your body moving downwards, acknowledging any tension or relaxation you find along the way. Feel the small muscles in your face, the rise and fall of your chest with each breath, the weight of your arms, and the pressure of your body on the surface you're sitting on.\n\n<PAUSE: 30>\n\nImagine your awareness expanding beyond your physical body. You're now observing the room you’re in — the space, the objects, the atmosphere. Notice the temperature, the sounds, the stillness around you.\n\n<PAUSE: 20>\n\nExpand your perspective further to encompass your entire house or the building you’re in. Sense the other rooms, the walls, the roof over your head, and the foundation beneath you.\n\n<PAUSE: 20>\n\nNow, let your awareness extend out into the street where you live. Picture the pavement, the neighboring houses, the trees, and the people.\n\n<PAUSE: 20>\n\nContinue this journey outward into your neighborhood. Imagine all the streets branching out, the parks, the schools, and the local shops.\n\n<PAUSE: 20>\n\nExpand further still to your entire city. Visualize the bustling streets, the quiet parks, the rivers or lakes, and the communities within.\n\n<PAUSE: 20>\n\nNow widen your awareness to your entire country. Picture the various landscapes, from mountains to plains, forests to deserts, cities to rural areas, and all the people living their lives.\n\n<PAUSE: 20>\n\nExtend your consciousness even more to our whole planet. See the blue oceans, the vast continents, the skies full of clouds, and the multitude of ecosystems.\n\n<PAUSE: 30>\n\nShift your perspective out into our solar system, noticing the sun at the center, the planets revolving around it, including Earth. Feel the vastness and peace of the cosmic expanse.\n\n<PAUSE: 20>\n\nLet your awareness stretch further to encompass the Milky Way galaxy, with its countless stars and the mysteries it holds, casting your mind's eye over the spiral arms of our galactic home.\n\n<PAUSE: 30>\n\nBegin your journey back now. Come back to our solar system, feeling the presence of our sun and the planets around it.\n\n<PAUSE: 20>\n\nBring your focus back to our planet, Earth. See it suspended in space, teeming with life, our home among the stars.\n\n<PAUSE: 20>\n\nDraw your perspective inward to your country, visualizing its landscapes and cities.\n\n<PAUSE: 20>\n\nZoom back into your city, the familiar streets, buildings, and places.\n\n<PAUSE: 20>\n\nNarrow your focus again to your neighborhood, sensing the adjoining homes, the nearby trees, and common places you visit.\n\n<PAUSE: 20>\n\nReturn to the street you live on, noticing the familiar surroundings, the details, and the ambiance of your space.\n\n<PAUSE: 20>\n\nRe-focus on your house or building, bringing your awareness to the structure that shelters you.\n\n<PAUSE: 20>\n\nFinally, bring your perspective back into the room you are in. Feel the atmosphere around you, and notice the sensations of your body sitting here.\n\n<PAUSE: 20>\n\nBegin to deepen your breath. Wiggle your fingers and toes, and when you feel ready, gently open your eyes. You've come full circle from the vast universe back into the grounding presence of your own body.",
