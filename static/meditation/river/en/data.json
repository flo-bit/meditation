Now slowly exhale through your mouth, letting all the tension leave your body.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nPicture yourself sitting on a soft, grassy bank beside a gentle river. The water flows steadily, creating a soothing sound as it moves downstream. Feel the cool, fresh breeze on your face and the warmth of the sun on your skin.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nAs you sit by this tranquil river, begin to notice leaves slowly drifting on its surface. Each leaf represents a thought or feeling that arises in your mind. Allow yourself to see these thoughts and feelings without judgment, simply acknowledging them as they appear.\n\n<PAUSE: 15>\n\nWhen you notice a thought or feeling, place it gently onto one of the leaves. Watch as the leaf carries it downstream, moving further and further away from you. There’s no need to rush; let each leaf move naturally at its own pace.\n\n<PAUSE: 20>\n\nSome thoughts may be more persistent, trying to cling to the edge of your awareness. Acknowledge them with patience and kindness. Place them on a leaf and watch as they too drift away. Know that it’s perfectly normal for thoughts and feelings to come and go.\n\n<PAUSE: 25>\n\nBring your attention back to the steady flow of the river. Feel the sense of calm and peace that comes from observing without holding on. Each time a thought or feeling arises, continue to place it on a leaf and let it drift by.\n\n<PAUSE: 20>\n\nNotice the space that is created in your mind when you allow these thoughts and feelings to pass by without attachment. This space is a place of stillness and clarity, a place where you can simply be.\n\n<PAUSE: 20>\n\nTake a moment to appreciate the gentle flow of the river and the ease with which it carries your thoughts away. Recognize that this moment of calm is always within you, accessible whenever you need it.\n\n<PAUSE: 15>\n\nBegin to bring your awareness back to your physical surroundings. Feel the ground beneath you, the support of the chair or the floor. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, gently open your eyes, carrying this sense of peace and calm with you into the rest of your day.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>",
