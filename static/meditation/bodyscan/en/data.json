Exhale slowly through your mouth, letting go of any immediate tension you might be holding onto. \n\n<PAUSE: 5>\n\nNow, bring your attention to your toes. Notice any sensations, whether they are warm, cool, tingling, or even numb. As you acknowledge these sensations, allow any tension you find there to release. Imagine your toes becoming heavy and relaxed.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nMove your awareness to your feet, feeling each part — the arches, the heel, and the tops of your feet. Notice any points of stress, and give permission for that stress to melt away. Feel the weight of your feet sinking down, becoming fully supported by the surface beneath you.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nShift your focus slowly up to your ankles. Sense their connection to your feet. Are they tight or flexible? Let the muscles around your ankles soften and release.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nNow, travel your awareness to your lower legs, from your shins to your calves. Feel the strong bones and muscles here, and notice any tightness. As you become aware of it, let it fade away, feeling your legs grow lighter.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nNext, bring your attention to your knees, sensing any stiffness or comfort. Breathe into this space and with each exhale, allow your knees to become more relaxed and at ease.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nMove to your thighs, feeling the large muscles here. Notice any heaviness or twinges of discomfort. Acknowledge these sensations and let go, allowing your thighs to relax and release any stored tension.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nBring your awareness to your hips and pelvis. Feel the connection to your lower body. This is an area where many of us hold tension. Breathe deeply, and on each exhale, release any tightness you might be storing here. \n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nNow, focus on your lower back and abdomen. Notice if you are holding any tension in these areas. As you breathe, allow your lower back to relax, and let your abdomen rise and fall naturally with each breath.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nMove your attention up to your chest and upper back. Sense any tightness or pressure. Breathe into this area, feeling the expansion and contraction with each breath, and let any held tension dissipate.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nBring your focus to your shoulders, knowing they often carry a heavy burden. Acknowledge any stiffness, then visualize it melting away. Let your shoulders drop and become loose.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nNow, travel down your arms to your elbows, wrists, and hands. Notice any areas that feel tense or strained. Let these parts become heavy and relaxed, releasing all tension with each breath out.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nShift your focus to your neck and throat. Feel any tightness or discomfort. Breathe deeply and as you exhale, let this area soften and release. \n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nFinally, bring your awareness to your head — your jaw, cheeks, eyes, and forehead. Notice any clenching or furrowing. Allow each part to relax, feeling your entire face soften as you breathe out.\n\n<PAUSE: 15>\n\nTake one last deep breath in, filling your entire body with calm and relaxation. Exhale slowly, letting go of any remaining tension. Sit or lie here for a few more moments, enjoying the feeling of complete relaxation. \n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nWhen you're ready, gently bring your awareness back to the room, and slowly open your eyes. Feel refreshed and centered, ready to continue with your day.",
