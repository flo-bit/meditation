Take a deep breath in through your nose, hold for a moment, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Allow yourself to settle and relax.\n\n<PAUSE: 5>\n\nNow, bring your attention to the center of your chest. Visualize a small, warm, glowing light within you. This light is cozy and inviting, radiating a gentle, golden warmth.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nWith your next inhale, imagine this light growing a little brighter, a little bigger. As you exhale, let it spread softly, filling your chest with its warmth and positivity.\n\n<PAUSE: 15>\n\nEach breath you take nourishes this light, making it stronger and more vibrant. Inhale deeply through your nose, and as you do, see the light expanding further, filling your upper body, your shoulders, and your arms. Feel the gentle warmth spreading, bringing a sense of calm and peace.\n\n<PAUSE: 20>\n\nExhale slowly, and with each breath out, let go of any tension or stress, allowing the light to dissolve them. Inhale again, and visualize the light moving downwards, filling your abdomen, your hips, your legs, and finally reaching your toes. Your entire body is now filled with this radiant, healing light.\n\n<PAUSE: 25>\n\nFeel its gentle warmth surrounding every part of you, bringing with it a deep sense of relaxation and comfort. As you sit with this feeling, know that this light represents peace and healing. It’s always within you, always accessible.\n\n<PAUSE: 20>\n\nTake a moment to embrace this glowing warmth, to let it soothe and rejuvenate you. With each breath, allow yourself to become more and more immersed in this peaceful, healing energy.\n\n<PAUSE: 30>\n\nWhen you are ready to return to your day, slowly bring your awareness back to your surroundings. Wiggle your fingers and toes, gently open your eyes, and take one last deep breath, carrying this warmth and positivity with you.",
