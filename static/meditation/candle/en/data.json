Close your eyes gently, taking a deep breath in, and slowly exhaling.\n\n<PAUSE: 5>\n\nNow, begin to visualize a candle in front of you, its flame steady and flickering with a soft, calming light. \n\n<PAUSE: 5>\n\nFocus on the vibrant colors in the flame: the deep orange, hints of blue, and the bright yellow at the core. Notice how the flame dances and sways, moving fluidly yet remaining constant.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nAllow your attention to be completely captivated by the flame. See how it never truly stays still, and yet its presence is calming and enduring. Feel your thoughts start to dissolve, melting away in the warmth of this singular point of focus.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nAs you continue to concentrate on the candle flame, become aware of your breath. Each inhale and exhale mirrors the gentle flickering of the flame. Let your breath flow naturally, effortlessly synchronized with the rhythm of the dancing light.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nIf you notice any thoughts or distractions creeping in, just acknowledge them without judgment, and gently guide your focus back to the flame. Imagine them as bubbles, floating away in the air, dissolving into the flame, absorbed by its light.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nFeel a sense of peace and clear-mindedness as you look into the bright and lively flame. The more you focus, the more your mind merges with this stability and serenity.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nNow, slowly begin to expand your awareness back to your body. Feel the weight of your body on the seat, notice the sensation of your hands resting in your lap, your feet touching the ground.\n\n<PAUSE: 5>\n\nGradually allow your attention to return to your surroundings. Take a deep breath in, feeling refreshed and clear, and exhale gently. Start to move your fingers and your toes, bringing gentleness into your movement as you prepare to open your eyes and return to the present moment.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nWhen you are ready, open your eyes, carrying with you a sense of calm and clarity into the rest of your day.",
