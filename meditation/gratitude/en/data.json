Take a deep breath in... and slowly exhale.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nWe'll begin with a few moments of stillness. Breathe in deeply once more, and as you exhale, let go of any tension. Allow your breathing to become natural and gentle.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nNow, bring to mind the first thing you are grateful for today. It could be a person, a place, an experience, or something as simple as your morning cup of coffee. Picture it clearly in your mind.\n\n<PAUSE: 25>\n\nAllow gratitude to flow into your heart. Let it expand and fill you. Feel the warmth and contentment that comes with this appreciation.\n\n<PAUSE: 20>\n\nNow, let's move to the second thing you're grateful for. Again, it could be something or someone big or small. Hold this image or thought clearly in your mind.\n\n<PAUSE: 25>\n\nAs you focus on this second source of gratitude, invite feelings of thankfulness into your heart. Let it grow, filling you with warmth, happiness, and peace.\n\n<PAUSE: 20>\n\nLastly, bring to mind the third thing you are grateful for today. Again, hold this clearly in your mind, savoring the details.\n\n<PAUSE: 25>\n\nAllow your gratitude to deepen. Feel it spreading warmth through your body. Allow this sense of thankfulness to fill every part of your being, bringing with it a sense of peace and contentment.\n\n<PAUSE: 30>\n\nNow, take a moment to savor this collective gratitude, feeling it radiate within you. Recognize that being in this state of gratitude brings you into closer harmony with yourself and the world around you.\n\n<PAUSE: 25>\n\nBegin to bring your attention back to the room, wiggling your fingers and toes gently. Take a deep breath in... and slowly exhale.\n\n<PAUSE: 10>\n\nWhen you are ready, gently open your eyes. Carry this sense of gratitude and warmth with you throughout your day.",
