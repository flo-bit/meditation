Notice the softness of your gummy bear body, relaxed and pliable. <PAUSE: 5>\n\nVisualize yourself now in a cozy room made entirely of marzipan. In this room, find a marzipan bed or a marzipan chair, crafted with swirls and patterns, inviting you to rest. <PAUSE: 6>\n\nSlowly settle your gummy bear self onto this marzipan surface. Feel its soft, slightly sticky texture supporting you, molding to your shape. <PAUSE: 5>\n\nAs you sink a little deeper, feel any tension in your gummy bear body dissolve, melting away into the cushioned marzipan. <PAUSE: 6>\n\nInhale deeply and as you exhale, envision yourself sinking even more into this comfortable marzipan. Each breath out makes you sink a bit further, releasing more and more tension. <PAUSE: 10>\n\nTake a moment to appreciate how the marzipan supports every part of you, wrapping you in its confectionary embrace. Feel the gentle pressure on your gummy bear back, legs, and arms, as you become one with this sweet, soft environment. <PAUSE: 8>\n\nYou are now perfectly nestled, the marzipan conforming to every curve of your gummy bear body. Notice the serene stillness and how deeply rooted you feel in this comforting space. <PAUSE: 10>\n\nFocus again on your breath. With each slow inhale, imagine a wave of calmness washing over you. With each exhale, feel your gummy bear body sink just a little deeper into the marzipan, grounding you further. <PAUSE: 8>\n\nThis marzipan chair or bed is your sanctuary. Here, you are safe, relaxed, and at peace. Embrace this moment of comfort, letting go completely. Just you, a gummy bear, cradled by marzipan. <PAUSE: 10>\n\nWhenever you're ready to return, start by gently wiggling your gummy bear fingers and toes, feeling the marzipan ease around them. <PAUSE: 5>\n\nSlowly, begin to bring your awareness back to the room around you. Feel the softness of your marzipan seat one last time, absorbing every ounce of relaxation. <PAUSE: 6>\n\nTake one final deep breath in and exhale. Gently open your eyes, carrying the peace of this sweet, imaginative experience with you. <PAUSE: 5>",
